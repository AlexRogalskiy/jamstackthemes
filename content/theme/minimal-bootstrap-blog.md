# minimal-bootstrap-blog

minimal-bootstrap-blog is a no frills, fully-responsive, hyper-minimalistic dark/light theme made with bootstrap-dark-5: https://github.com/vinorodrigues/bootstrap-dark-5. The theme is heavily inspired by Mark Otto's personal site: https://markdotto.com/

Demo: https://andrewhwanpark.github.io/minimal-bootstrap-blog/

My personal site that uses the same theme: https://andrewhwanpark.github.io/

## Features

- Automatically changes from dark/light modes depending on the OS settings.
- Easy integration with Google Analytics.
- Generates XML sitemap and RSS Atom feed.
- jekyll-seo-tag to add metadata tags for search engines and social networks to better index and display your site's content.
- Full markdown support: code blocks and tables are automatically bootstrap components.
